### Training and Skill Gaps:

Determine if there are any skill gaps in the team that need addressing.
Consider training, workshops, or hiring to fill those gaps.
### Stakeholder Relationships:

### Openness to Change:

### Time Management:
As a tech lead, you'll juggle multiple responsibilities. Consider how you'll manage your time between coding, mentoring, meetings, and other tasks.
