# Architecture decisioning

## Introduction:
Making architecture decisions as a tech lead is a pivotal task that requires a systematic approach to ensure alignment with both technical and business goals. Here's a step-by-step guide to making informed architecture decisions:

### Understand the Requirement:

Engage with stakeholders (product managers, business analysts, etc.) to gather and clarify the specific needs and constraints.
### Document the Context:

Clearly define the problem.
Detail the system's current state, constraints, and expected changes.
### Research and Brainstorm:

Investigate various architectural patterns and solutions that might fit.
Seek input from the team and other experts.
### Evaluate Options:

List the pros and cons of each potential solution.
Consider factors like scalability, maintainability, security, cost, and alignment with existing systems.
### Prototype (if feasible):

For complex or uncertain decisions, it might be beneficial to create a proof of concept.
This helps in understanding potential pitfalls or validating assumptions.
### Consider Non-functional Requirements:

Think about performance, security, scalability, maintainability, etc., as these can significantly influence the architectural decision.
### Stakeholder Feedback:

Present your findings and recommendations to key stakeholders for feedback.
This includes both technical and non-technical teams.
### Make the Decision:

After considering all factors and receiving feedback, make an informed decision.
### Document the Decision:

Clearly document the decision, rationale, considered alternatives, and any associated risks or assumptions.
This is vital for future reference and understanding by anyone who wasn't part of the decision-making process.
### Communicate the Decision:

Ensure the entire team, and any other relevant parties, are aware of the decision, its implications, and the reasons behind it.
### Implement & Validate:
Begin the process of implementing the architectural decision.
Regularly validate that the chosen architecture meets the set requirements and expectations.
### Review and Iterate:
Architectural decisions are not set in stone. Periodically review them in the context of new requirements, technological changes, or lessons learned from the implementation.
Be open to revising decisions if it becomes evident that they are not serving the project well.
### Learn from Feedback:
Collect feedback from the implementation phase and post-implementation to understand what went well and what could be improved.
Remember, the best architectural decisions often balance technical excellence with business needs, and they benefit from collaborative input and iterative refinement.
