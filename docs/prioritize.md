# Prioritize work

## Introduction:
WSJF, or Weighted Shortest Job First, is a prioritization model used in the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to help organizations determine the sequence of features or capabilities to develop. WSJF is calculated by dividing the Cost of Delay (CoD) by the job size or effort.

Here's the formula for WSJF:

**WSJF** = **CoD** (Cost of Delay) / **Job Size**

Where:

### Cost of Delay (CoD) 
is a combination of:
- User Business Value: The value delivered to the user.
- Time Criticality: The importance of timely delivery.
- Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement: The value of information or opportunity the feature provides.

### Job Size
represents the effort required to complete the job (e.g., the feature or capability). This could be in story points, person-days, or any other estimation metric.

By using the WSJF score, teams can prioritize jobs in a way that delivers the maximum economic benefit in the shortest amount of time. The job with the highest WSJF score should ideally be the next one to be worked on.
